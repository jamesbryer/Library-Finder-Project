# Library Finder

## Business Case

### Problem statement
People are bored in Lockdown and have decided they want to start reading more books, therefore they want to know where their nearest library is. We will develop a simple app that helps users find their nearest Library.

### Business benefits
1. Users will be able to find their nearest library very easily.
2. Libraries can be a community hub, lots of different activities occur there, this could help connect people.
3. Students can easily use the library to study and help improve their coursework.

### Options Considered
Google maps will also show nearby libraries, however results can be cluttered with other surrounding points of interest. For this reason, we chose to run with Open Street Maps, as it is much less cluttered than Google Maps and has a good degree of accuracy and coverage ovre Bristol.

### Expected Risks
Especially during COVID-19 pandemic, opening hours and availability can vary and it is possible the libraries could be closed.

## Project Scope
1. have user friendly interface
2. take location input from user
3. access library data
4. show library data in a map and a table
