# Testing

## Test Plan
UC1: created a test file and used mocha to test the selection of a postcode region to display results.

UC2:
TODO: Describe any manual and automated (unit) tests. Uniquely identify each test case. Include prerequisites and test data.

UC3:
Using testcafe, I created a test script to ensure dropdown menu worked and displayed results

## Test Runs
UC1: I tested this three times, it worked every time.
