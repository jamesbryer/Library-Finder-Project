# Design

## Behavioural design
UC1: Library user access web page, they want to see their nearby libraries so they select their postcode zone and click to get results. The system then accesses the database (data taken from Bristol Open Data) and gets the results within the selected postcode zone, then the web page will display these results in a table.
